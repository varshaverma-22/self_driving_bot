# Self-Driving Bot using Arduino and Proteus

## 🚗 Project Description
This project demonstrates a **Self-Driving Bot** using Arduino, simulated on **Proteus** software. The bot is capable of navigating its environment autonomously by using sensors to detect obstacles and make decisions accordingly.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- DC Motors
- Motor Driver (L298N)
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Power Supply
- Proteus Simulation Software

## 🛠️ Files Included
- `selfdrivingbot.ino` : Arduino source code for the self-driving bot.
- `selfdrivingbot.pdsprj` : Proteus project file for simulation.
- `selfdrivingbot.7z` : Compressed project files and resources.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Open the `.pdsprj` file in Proteus software.
2. Upload the provided `selfdrivingbot.ino` code to the Arduino component within the simulation.
3. Run the simulation to observe the self-driving bot in action.

## 📦 How to Use
- Clone or download this repository.
- Extract the files.
- Open the Proteus project and upload the Arduino code.
- Simulate and observe the bot navigating autonomously.

## 🤖 Features
- Obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors.
- Automatic path adjustment.
- Fully simulated environment using Proteus.

## 📚 Future Improvements
- Adding IR sensors for line tracking.
- Improving path optimization algorithms.
- Real-world hardware implementation.
